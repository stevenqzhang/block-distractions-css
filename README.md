Custom CSS to block distractions on common sites

# Motivation

I often get distracted. Clearly I'm not the only one (see optional reading).

I've used custom site-scoped CSS rules to block distracting elements for years now (i.e. Gmail unread count, Facebook like notifications"

One of these days I may bundle all these CSS rules into a Chrome Extension to aid ease of installation for non-technical folks

# How to use

Install [this extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-css/okpjlejfhacmgjkmknjhadmkdbcldfcb?hl=en) and copy paste the CSS rules from this repo
